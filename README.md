# NeuralNets
I've been wanting to mess around with Neural Networks for a while, so here is the repository where the files will be stored

Initially, this is very very basic (not sure if it even qualifies as a neural network, technically) but it employs the same
ideas as a neural network, if in very basic form. Hopefully I can transition to building something more advanced in the near
future.

Until then, cheers!

PS, here is a blog post I wrote on this stuff: http://jasondrain.io/a-rudimentary-neural-network.html
